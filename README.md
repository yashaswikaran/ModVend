# ModVend
Designed and implemented a protocol-driven smart vending machine using Verilog, with MODBUS RTU as the communication backbone. The system receives commands over a UART interface from an external master (e.g., PC or PLC), and uses a dual-clock FIFO to safely bridge data between asynchronous UART and system logic domains. A custom finite state machine (FSM) interprets MODBUS commands, interacts with dual-port RAM for inventory management, and generates MODBUS-compliant responses over UART.
Unlike traditional vending FSMs that rely on hardcoded buttons and direct control signals, this design is fully protocol-driven, enabling remote command execution, error checking via CRC, and register-based access to item stock and control signals â€” all standard practices in real-world industrial automation systems.
